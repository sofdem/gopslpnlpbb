One of the major issue in research and developement in pump scheduling problem is related to scarce of instances to scrutinize the effectiveness of the approaches in global optimization or in primal heuristics context. To address this issue, we added another network to previous ones (\textit{Simple network, Richmond, and Anytown}): van Zyl water network distrbution introduced by J.E. van Zyl et al. as a ready-to-use instances for lp nlp bb algorithm. The network comprises two symmetrical pump, one boost pump parallel to a check valve and two tanks with different capacities. 
Moreover, we have generated large amount of instances, each has different tariff and demand profiles. The tariff is from Belgian spot market data. The demand profile is derived from real consumption data of a network in Brittany.
