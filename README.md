One of the significant challenges in research and development regarding pump scheduling problems lies in the scarcity of instances available for analyzing the effectiveness of global optimization strategies and primal heuristic contexts. To overcome this hurdle, we have introduced an additional network to our existing set, which previously included Simple network, Richmond, and Anytown: the van Zyl water distribution network, presented by J.E. van Zyl et al. This network serves as ready-to-use instances for LP, NLP, and BB algorithms.

The van Zyl water distribution network is characterized by two symmetrical pumps, a boost pump operating parallel to a check valve, and two tanks possessing disparate capacities.

Furthermore, we have generated a substantial amount of new instances, each featuring unique tariff and demand profiles. The tariff profiles are based on Belgian spot market data, while the demand profiles are drawn from real consumption data sourced from a network based in a touristic zone in Brittany, France. This extensive generation of instances should provide a richer basis for testing and developing optimization techniques and heuristics in pump scheduling.

The generated data related to water consumtion during 10 days is depiced as below:
